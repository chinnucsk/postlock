# What is postlock? #
The postlock project's goal is to provide globally shared state for application developers without requiring them to explicitly lock or synchronize anything. For more details, please visit <http://www.postlock.org>.

# What is the project's status? #
Postlock is very much a work in progress, we're working to get unit tests off the ground.

Although you won't be able to build the next killer application for the web with postlock just yet, stay tuned, check back frequently, and -if you can- contribute!

For details, see <http://www.postlock.org>.
