# What is postlock? #
A lockless concurrency library for Javascript. Postlock immediately applies your changes to shared data. In case of conflict, further operations resolve the issue. In addition to concurrency you get versioned persistence of your javascript data for free.

# How do I use postlock? #
Postlock is currently not ready to be used. We are working as fast as we can to deliver this awsome tool. If you help out, we'll get there faster...
